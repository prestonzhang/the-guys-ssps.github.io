---

They woke up early in the morning. The sun was shining bright on Obi-wan's window. Obi-wan thought to himself "That was just a dream, I dreamed that my ship crashed at Hogworts and that I made friends with Dumbledore. He opened his eyes.He looked around himself. He was in a room with a beautiful carpet. He got up and gasped. He had looked above him and had seen on the top of his bed another bed and sleeping on top of the bed above his was a bearded old man! The man looked strangly familmar. The man suddenly said to him "Why so early Obi-wan?". The man knew his name! Obi-Wan said "Who are you? And why do you know my name?". Dumbledore said "Don't you remember me? I'm Dumbledore. This is _not_ a dream.". Obi-Wan shook his head. Dumbledore said "Whatever you do, this is not a dream. This is real. First things first; lets eat our breakfast!". Dumbledore continued "Today's breakfast is: French toast, shortbread, chocolate frogs, eggs, bacon, fat-free milk, 1% fat milk, whole milk, and Hogwarts pudding!"🥛🥚🥓🍞🍮.

After "breakfast", Obi-Wan, R2-D2, the Jedi team, and Dumbledore talked in the meeting room. "Do you want to stay?" asked Dumbledore; "Or we get your ship repaired and you leave?" continued Dumbledore. "We want to leave." said Obi-wan. "Ok but at least have some tea would you?" said Dumbledore. After the tea party, this is what happened: "We changed our mind;" said Obi-wan, "We want to stay. We can defeat evil villains together.💪" "Hmmmmm, I suppose that'll be OK", said Dumbledore. "Hallelujah!!!!" said Obi-wan.

  "If we are going to fight villans then lets get started! There is no time to waste" said Dumbledore importantly. "Agreed." said Obi-Wan truthfully. Then Obi-Wan's crew appeared behind their boss. "Do you need us boss?" they asked. "Actually I do." said Obi-Wan. The crew blinked exitedly at this and waited for instructions from their leader. "I want you to alert everyone in here and meet us in the entrance hall at 3:25 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. ok? Can you do that for us?" continued Obi-Wan. "Yes boss" the crew said. "May I ask you why boss?" said the crew. Obi-Wan and Dumbledore exchanged awkward glances 🙄. "We need a plan." said Obi-Wan to his crew. Then the crew left without another word. 

That day, Obi-Wan's crew arrived at 3:35 p.m. "You are late!!!" said Obi-Wan. "Sorry, boss" said Obi-Wan's crew. "Remember yesterday I had the great plan of meeting in the entrace hall?" Obi-Wan said, "Here it is!". "Y'all wait here. I'll go ask Dumbledore the join the meeting" suggested Obi-Wan. "Fine with me!" said the crew. A few minutes later, Obi-Wan arrived with Dumbledore. He said "OK, let's start. If we want to defeat villains, we start with an army.". "```We can ask Yoda to bring us an army```" suggested R2D2. "Good idea!" said Obi-Wan, "One question though: how do we let Yoda know that we need an army? 🤔". 

"We can use an owl post!" suggested Dumbledore. Obi-Wan and his crew were puzzled: "What's an owl p-". Dumbledore grinned happily and said "It's just an owl 🦉carrying a letter ✉️. And the owl will fly to the person you want to deliver to, and drop the letter on the window sill or mail slot". "Ohhhhh~~~ 😮" said Obi-Wan and his crew, amazed. "Sooooo~, should we do it?" asked Dumbledore. "Sure, why not!" replied a man in Obi-Wan's crew with a green, strange-looking sword that has two red buttons on its handle that also look very strange. Dumbledored noticed the sword and asked, "Wait a second. What is it that you are holding, young fellow?". "Oh, it's a light saber!" the man replied. This time, it was Dumbledore who was puzzled, and he asked "What's a light sa-". "It's just a sword that doesn't have a blade. But it has a strange green or blue laser light that immediately burns whatever it touches. Also, you can activate it pressing this red button, and turn it off by pressing THIS red button."
